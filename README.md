Welcome to my amazing Intel 8080 Emulator, which can currently run Space Invaders!! 

This is an emulation of the Intel 8080 processor and the Space Invaders external hardware. I also  
programmed the I/O and the graphics.

###Instructions to use
You will need Xcode to run the application. Open up the xcodeproj file and run the project

The controls are as such:
Left / A : move left
Right / S: move right
Space: shoot
c: insert coin
1: start player 1

Enjoy!
