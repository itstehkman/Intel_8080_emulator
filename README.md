## Intel 8080 Emulator!!

This is an emulation of the Intel 8080 processor and the Space Invaders external hardware. I also  
programmed the I/O and the graphics rendering. The main purpose of this project was to create
the emulator from scratch to fully understand how the microprocessor works, and also to see
Space Invaders come to life (a very satisfying feeling!). With some hard work this code can be extended
to turn into a Gameboy Original emulator, since the architecture for that is very similar to the Intel 8080, with
256 additional instructions.

### Instructions to use
You will need Xcode to run the application. Open up the xcodeproj file and run the project

The controls are as such:
Left / A : move left<br>
Right / S: move right<br>
Space: shoot<br>
c: insert coin<br>
1: start player 1<br>

Enjoy!
